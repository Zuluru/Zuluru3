<p><?= __('By default, name matches are exact. That is, searching for "Steve" will match only Steve, not Steven or Stephen. If you\'re not sure what form the person uses, you can use * as a "wildcard". For example, "Ste*" will match Steve, Steven, Stephen, Stephanie, or anything else starting with Ste.') ?></p>
<p><?= __('Wildcards can also be helpful if you\'re not sure how to spell someone\'s last name. For example, married women may be listed in the system with a hyphenated last name, but you might know them by their maiden name, in which case "Smith*" would match not only Smith, Smithers and Smitherman, but also Smith-Jones, etc. Wildcards can also appear at the beginning or in the middle, so "*Smith*" would additionally match Jones-Smith, etc., and "T*om*son" would match Thompson, Tompson or Thomson.') ?></p>
<p><?= __('If you only know the person\'s first or last name, you can enter only that, but expect more results. Entering both names, if you know them, will provide a much smaller result set.') ?></p>
<p><?= __('Searches are NOT case-sensitive, so searching for "smith", "Smith" or "SMITH" will all give the same results.') ?></p>
