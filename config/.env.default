# Used as a default to seed config/.env which enables you to use environment
# variables to configure the aspects of your application that vary by
# environment. This provides a simpler development workflow over standard
# environment variables.
#
# To use this file, first copy it into `config/.env`. In typical scenarios,
# this is best done by visiting the /installer URL in your browser. See
# README.md for installation details.

# System settings
########################

# Setting this to true puts the system into debug mode, which can help to
# diagnose installation errors. This should always be the first thing to try
# if you are getting the "white screen of death". However, error messages
# that it will display can give away information about your system setup to
# potential attackers, plus it will slow down operations, so it should never
# be used in a production environment.
export DEBUG="false"

# This must be set to the base URL of your site, without a trailing slash.
# This will be used in things like system-generated emails.
export SITE_BASE_URL="{default_baseurl}"

# See http://ca3.php.net/timezones for a list of valid timezone names. You
# may need to follow the instructions from
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html
# to make all timezone names available.

# The default locale for translation, formatting currencies and numbers, date
# and time.

# This is the generic word to be used for all field-type spaces that the
# site will deal with. If you offer ultimate, volleyball and hockey, you
# will need to find something that conveys "field, court or rink". Perhaps
# "location"?
export FIELD_NAME="field"

# For proper security, this MUST be set to a long, random string of bytes.
# It is recommended to use at least 32 bytes. NOTE: If you ever change this
# after users are registered, everyone will need to do a password reset, so
# be sure to set it right away! This handy link will give you two random 20
# character strings you can paste together to get a nice 40 character salt:

# For optimal deliverability, bounce handling, etc. it is recommended
# to use the Smtp transport. If you do, you MUST provide the username,
# password and host, and may also need to change the port and other settings.
# If Smtp is not an option for you, you can use the 'Mail' transport (set
# this in the "EMAIL_TRANSPORT" field), in which case the SMTP fields can
# be ignored or deleted from here, but you will then need to set the
# "EMAIL_FROM" address.
